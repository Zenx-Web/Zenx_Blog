## Deployment to Hostinger

### Step 1: Prepare Build Output
```bash
# Build for production
npm run build

# The output will be in the .next folder
```

### Step 2: Configure Hostinger
Since Hostinger shared hosting doesn't natively support Next.js, you have two options:

#### Option A: Deploy to Vercel (Recommended)
1. Push code to GitHub
2. Import project to Vercel: https://vercel.com/new
3. Add environment variables in Vercel dashboard
4. Point your domain `imzenx.in` to Vercel using CNAME

#### Option B: Use Hostinger VPS
1. Upgrade to VPS hosting
2. Install Node.js 18+ and PM2
3. Upload files via SFTP
4. Run production server with PM2

### Step 3: Environment Variables
Copy all variables from `.env.local` to your hosting platform:

**Required Variables:**
- `NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_URL`
- `NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY`
- `SUPABASE_SERVICE_ROLE_KEY`
- `OPENAI_API_KEY`
- `GOOGLE_GEMINI_API_KEY`
- `UNSPLASH_ACCESS_KEY`
- `ADMIN_EMAIL`
- `ADMIN_PASSWORD`
- `ADMIN_SESSION_SECRET`
- `NEXTAUTH_SECRET`
- `NEXT_PUBLIC_SITE_URL` (set to https://imzenx.in)

**Optional Variables:**
- `GOOGLE_TRENDS_API_KEY`
- `NEWS_API_KEY`
- `REDDIT_CLIENT_ID`
- `REDDIT_CLIENT_SECRET`

### Step 4: Domain Configuration
1. In Hostinger DNS settings, add:
   - For Vercel: CNAME record pointing to `cname.vercel-dns.com`
   - For VPS: A record pointing to your VPS IP
2. Update `NEXT_PUBLIC_SITE_URL` to `https://imzenx.in`
3. Wait for DNS propagation (up to 48 hours)

### Step 5: Post-Deployment
1. Visit `https://imzenx.in/admin/login`
2. Login with credentials from `ADMIN_EMAIL` and `ADMIN_PASSWORD`
3. Generate your first blog post
4. Test all features:
   - Image loading

   - Category filtering
   - Social sharing
